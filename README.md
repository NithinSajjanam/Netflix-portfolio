## 📚 Getting Started

Want to set this up locally? Follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Copy the repository to your local system.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Use a package manager to install the required dependencies.

```bash
nvm install 18
nvm use 18
```

After upgrading Node.js, clear your node_modules and reinstall:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules
npm cache clean --force
npm install
```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**: Create a `.env` file in the project root and set up the necessary DatoCMS API tokens.

   Create a `.env` file with the following content, replacing the placeholders with your actual DatoCMS API tokens:

   ```
   # DatoCMS API Tokens
   # Obtain these from https://dashboard.datocms.com/

   # For localhost and ror.sumanthsamala.com
   REACT_APP_DATOCMS_ROR_TOKEN=your_actual_dato_cms_api_token_here

   # For java.localhost and java.sumanthsamala.com
   REACT_APP_DATOCMS_JAVA_TOKEN=your_actual_dato_cms_api_token_here

   # For frontend.localhost and frontend.sumanthsamala.com
   REACT_APP_DATOCMS_FRONTEND_TOKEN=your_actual_dato_cms_api_token_here

   # For node.localhost and node.sumanthsamala.com
   REACT_APP_DATOCMS_NODE_TOKEN=your_actual_dato_cms_api_token_here
   ```

   **Note**: The `.env` file is already included in `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits of sensitive information.

4. **Run the Project**: Start the development server.

```bash
npm start
```

5. **Visit the Local Server**: Open your browser and navigate to the local server URL.
